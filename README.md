# Arch-LINUX-DRIVERS-proplem-
This is indeed a complex task, as Manjaro and Arch Linux, while related, handle drivers and packages differently. Here's a step-by-step approach to get the drivers from Manjaro onto your Arch Linux system:

1. On Manjaro, list all installed packages:
   ```
   pacman -Q > manjaro_packages.txt
   ```

2. Transfer this file to your Arch Linux system.

3. On Arch, filter for driver packages:
   ```
   grep -E '(driver|module)' manjaro_packages.txt > driver_packages.txt
   ```

4. Now, you'll need to manually review this list. Some drivers might be Manjaro-specific or already included in Arch.

5. For each driver you want to install:
   - Check if it's available in the Arch repositories:
     ```
     pacman -Ss package_name
     ```
   - If available, install it:
     ```
     sudo pacman -S package_name
     ```
   - If not available, you may need to use the AUR or compile from source.

6. For hardware detection, install `hw-probe` on both systems:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S hw-probe
   ```
   Run it on both systems and compare the output to ensure you haven't missed any drivers.

7. Pay special attention to graphics drivers, Wi-Fi drivers, and any specific hardware you have.

8. Some drivers might require kernel modules. Check `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` on Manjaro and add necessary modules to your Arch system.

9. After installing drivers, rebuild your initramfs:
   ```
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
   ```

10. Reboot your system to apply changes.

Remember, this process requires careful consideration. Not all Manjaro drivers will be necessary or compatible with your Arch system. You may need to troubleshoot and adjust as you go.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this process?
